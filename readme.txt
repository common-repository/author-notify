What is it?

Author Notify is a wordpress plugin to show a message box in all the posts by a particular author. I thought about writing this plugin because my wife moved her blog out to a new domain, and I want to put up this notification to all her posts.

This plugin is also useful when multiple writers are writing on one blog, and one of them needs to put up an announcement in all his/her posts.

Version 0.1 of the Plugin is now available for download! This version has been tested on WordPress 2.1.3, but from the way I write it, it should run on all versions.

This version contains the following improvements:

    * From zero to zero point one, an increase of infinity! (0.1-0)/0=infinity

I do not ask for donations for writing this plugin, please email me and let me know you are using it, that will make me very happy.


Installation:

  1. Download the file, and unzip authornotify.php into your wordpress plugins directory.
  2. Activate the plugin in your ¡°Plugins¡± interface.
  3. Go to ¡°Options¡±¨C>¡±Author Notify¡±, to change the ¡°author nickname¡±, and the ¡°message¡±.
